古莲花峰Ancient Lotus Peak
莲花峰位于海门海滨，距汕头市区约22公里，因山石开裂如莲花而得名，是具有自然和人文景观的旅游胜地，首批国家AAA级景区之一。南宋末年，爱国将领文天祥曾寻踪流亡皇帝至此，遥望海上，慨叹宋之将亡，剑刻“终南”。后人为纪念文天祥在此建祠立像。峰之正面有“莲花峰”石刻，系宋文天祥所题，清乾隆参将吴本汉七岁之幼子吴皋在其上加书“古”字，与原石刻浑然一体。
Ancient Lotus Peak
Lotus Peak, a scenic resort with natural and cultural landscapes, is located in the harbor of Haimen, about 22km away from Shantou City. The peak is named after a crack rock,which looks like a lotus, and is one of the first national AAA sceneries. In the late Song Dynasty, when famous patriotic general Wen Tian Xiang arrived at this place in pursuit of the escaping emperor, he carved two words on a big rock with his sword ---“South End”, implying that he was so sad about his country being about to perish. Centurys later, in memory of Wen Tianxiang, a stone statue of the general Wen and a memorial hall were built up on the spot. In the front of the peak, an inscription of “lotus peak” was inscribed by Wen Tianxiang himself. In addition, one captain in Qing dynasty, Wu Benhan’s 7-year-old son Wu Gao added a word “ancient” to it, and made it an intergrated inscription.
