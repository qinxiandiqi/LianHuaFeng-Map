奇泉井Strange Spring Well
宋文天祥登临此地时，正值干旱，兵马饮水困难。文天祥亲自率人沿沙滩勘得此泉，甘甜无比，遂扩大为井。奇怪的是，每当大海潮涨，泉孔为海水所没，潮退时泉水仍甘冽无比，人谓之奇泉，亦称“文泉井”。

Strange Spring Well
Wen Tianxiang and his troop arrived here during a drought, so his soliders and horses were short of drinking water. To search for water, he strolled on the beach and found a spring with clear and sweet water. So he dug a well there. However, it was quite strange that when the tides came, the spring well was flooded with salty sea water, but when the tides were gone, the spring water became sweet again. From then on people have called it “Strange Spring Well” , or “Wen Spring Well” .
