Under the savage policy of slaughtering all the people, robbing and destroyed all the houses, over 1400 houses and 460 fishing boats were burnt out, and more than 17,000 people were beheaded, or buried alive, or burnt to death, or died of starvation. The town used to have a population of 50,000, among which 17,000 were killed and 15000 fled from famine, only 18,000 survived. After the Anti-Japanese War, the dead victims were rounded up and buried together here at the foot of Lotus Peak. Thus this monument was set up by a charity in commemortion of the dead.</p>
