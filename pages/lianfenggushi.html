<img src="images/lfgs.jpg" alt=""/><p>莲峰古寺原名“观音堂”、“大士阁”，始建于明永乐年间，几经兴废，至明隆庆年间重修，更名为“钟南古刹”，清咸丰年间改建为“莲峰古寺”，门联：“莲峰环寺外，练水际天边”。至抗战期间，为日寇炮火所毁。1992年5月，经社会各界热心群众及海内外同胞募资重建，规模较前壮观。</p><p>Lotus Peak Temple was originally named “Guanyin Hall” or “Dashi Pavilion ”, when it was founded during Yongle Period of Ming Dynasty. After being deserted and repaired numerously, it was rebuilt in Longqing Period of Ming dynasty, and was renamed as “Zhongnan Old Temple”. Then in Xianfeng Period of Qing Dynasty it was rehabilitated as “Lotus Peak Temple”, engraved with the door couplet. “Lotus Peaks around the Temple, Lian River along the horizon”. However, the temple was burned down by the Japanese invaders during the Sino-Japanese War in 1940’s. Until 1992, local people in the communities and overseas Chinese raised funds and reconstructed it again in a much greater scale than before.</p>
