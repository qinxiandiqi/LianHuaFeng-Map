<h1>望夫石</h1>
<p>古代海上生产活动最为危险，加之没有天气预报，没有机械动力的渔船抗击风浪能力很差，每逢台风季节，此处便成了渔家女盼夫平安归来嘹望的地方。</p>
<h1>Expecting Husband Rock</h1>
<p>Husband-Expected Rock is the spot where fishmen’s wifes were expecting their husbands’ back home safely. In the ancient times, fishing at sea was one of the most dangerous way of living. For absence of weather forecasts and mechanical power, fishing boats were frequently struck by storms during the typhoon seasons.</p>
